# Comprehensive Overview
The FAiQ project is a complex system that consists of multiple components and features. This documentation provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture, components, and key features.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into several directories, including `app`, `config`, `database`, `resources`, `routes`, `storage`, and `tests`. Each directory contains specific files and subdirectories that are essential to the project's functionality.

## Key Components
The project consists of several key components, including:

* **Models**: The project uses Eloquent models to interact with the database. The models are defined in the `app/Models` directory and include files such as `Team.php`, `User.php`, and `FileQuestions.php`.
* **Controllers**: The project uses Laravel controllers to handle HTTP requests. The controllers are defined in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory and include files such as `BillingController.php`, `TeamParametersController.php`, and `FileController.php`.
* **Services**: The project uses services to encapsulate business logic. The services are defined in the `app/Services` directory and include files such as `VerifyingService.php`, `EmbeddingService.php`, and `RequestLoggerService.php`.
* **Jobs**: The project uses jobs to handle background tasks. The jobs are defined in the `app/Jobs` directory and include files such as `AskStreamJob.php`, `AskJob.php`, and `ProcessFile.php`.

## Component Relationships
The components in the project are related to each other in the following way:
