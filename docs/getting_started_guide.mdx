# Getting Started Guide
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running the FAiQ project, including installation, configuration, and deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- PHP
- Composer
- Node.js
- Docker (optional)

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/FAiQ.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd FAiQ`
3. Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
4. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
5. Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file

## Configuration
The project uses environment variables for configuration. You can find these variables in the `.env.example` file. Create a copy of this file named `.env` and adjust the settings as needed.

### Database Configuration
To configure the database, update the `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` variables in the `.env` file.

### Cache Configuration
The project uses a cache system. You can configure the cache driver in the `CACHE_DRIVER` variable in the `.env` file.

## Deployment
To deploy the project, you can use the following methods:
- **Local Deployment**: Run the project using the built-in PHP server: `php artisan serve`
- **Docker Deployment**: Build a Docker image and run a container: `docker build -t faiq .` and `docker run -p 8080:80 faiq`

## Setup Instructions
After deployment, you can access the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you specified).

### Running Migrations
To set up the database schema, run the migrations: `php artisan migrate`

### Seeding the Database
To populate the database with initial data, run the seeders: `php artisan db:seed`

## Mermaid Art Diagrams
The following mermaid diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the FAiQ project:
```mermaid

    A[Client] -->| Request |> B[Server]
    B -->| Response |> A
    B -->| Database Query |> C[Database]
    C -->| Query Result |> B
    B -->| Cache Query |> D[Cache]
    D -->| Cache Result |> B
```
This diagram shows the client-server interaction, database queries, and cache usage in the project.

## Code Examples
Here's an example of a controller method that handles a request:
```php
// app/Http/Controllers/ExampleController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        // Handle the request
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
    }
}
```
And here's an example of a migration file:
```php
// database/migrations/2024_10_18_124651_add_two_factor_columns_to_users_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

class AddTwoFactorColumnsToUsersTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->boolean('two_factor_enabled')->default(false);
            $table->string('two_factor_secret')->nullable();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('two_factor_enabled');
            $table->dropColumn('two_factor_secret');
        });
    }
}
```
These examples illustrate the structure and syntax of the project's codebase.
