# System Architecture and Key Design Decisions
The FAiQ project is built using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with Laravel as the framework. This documentation outlines the key components, design decisions, and technical infrastructure of the project.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- `app`: Contains the application's core code, including models, controllers, and services.
- `config`: Holds configuration files for the application, such as database settings and API keys.
- `database`: Includes database migrations, seeders, and factories.
- `public`: Serves as the public directory, containing the application's entry point and assets.
- `resources`: Contains front-end assets, including CSS, JavaScript, and Vue components.
- `routes`: Defines the application's routes, including web, API, and console routes.
- `storage`: Stores the application's files, including logs and cached data.
- `tests`: Includes unit and feature tests for the application.

## Database Schema
The database schema is defined in the `database/migrations` directory. Key tables include:
- `users`: Stores information about registered users.
- `teams`: Represents teams that users can belong to.
- `team_invitations`: Manages team invitations.
- `file_questions`: Stores questions related to files.
- `answers`: Contains answers to questions.
- `embeddings`: Represents embeddings, which are used for various AI-related tasks.
- `batch_jobs`: Manages batch jobs, which are used for processing large datasets.
- `subscriptions`: Stores subscription information for users.

## Key Design Decisions
- **MVC Pattern**: The application follows the MVC pattern, separating concerns into models, views, and controllers.
- **Laravel Framework**: The project uses Laravel as its framework, leveraging its built-in features and tools.
- **Front-end Assets**: Front-end assets, such as CSS and JavaScript files, are stored in the `resources` directory.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using Git.
2. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm install` to install front-end dependencies.
4. Create a database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials.
5. Run `php artisan migrate` to migrate the database.
6. Run `php artisan serve` to start the application.

## Diagrams
The following diagram illustrates the application's architecture:
```mermaid

    A[Front-end] -->|Request|> B[Controller]
    B -->|Query|> C[Model]
    C -->|Data|> B
    B -->|Response|> A
    C -->|Data|> D[Database]
    D -->|Data|> C
```
This diagram shows how the front-end interacts with the controller, which then queries the model. The model retrieves data from the database and returns it to the controller, which sends a response back to the front-end.
