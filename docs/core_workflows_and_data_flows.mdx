# Core Workflows and Data Flows
This documentation outlines the key workflows and data flows within the FAiQ project. It covers user interactions, data processing, and storage, providing a clear understanding of how the project's components interact to achieve its goals.

## System Architecture
The FAiQ project is built using a modular architecture, with separate components for user authentication, data processing, and storage. The system uses a combination of Laravel and Vue.js to provide a scalable and maintainable solution.

## User Registration and Login Flow
The user registration and login flow is handled by the `app/Http/Controllers/Auth` controller. The flow involves the following steps:
1. User registration: The user submits a registration form, which is validated and processed by the `RegisterController`.
2. User login: The user submits a login form, which is validated and processed by the `LoginController`.
3. Authentication: The user is authenticated using the `auth` middleware, which checks for valid credentials and verifies the user's identity.

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Submits registration form|> B[RegisterController]
    B -->|Validates and processes form|> C[UserRepository]
    C -->|Creates new user|> D[User]
    D -->|Logs in user|> E[LoginController]
    E -->|Validates and processes login form|> F[auth middleware]
    F -->|Authenticates user|> G[User]
```

## Data Processing and Storage Workflows
The data processing and storage workflows are handled by the `app/Services` and `app/Models` components. The workflows involve the following steps:
1. Data ingestion: Data is ingested from various sources, such as files and APIs.
2. Data processing: The ingested data is processed by the `BatchingService`, which performs tasks such as data cleaning and transformation.
3. Data storage: The processed data is stored in the `Database`, which uses a combination of MySQL and Redis to provide a scalable and performant solution.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Data source] -->|Ingests data|> B[BatchingService]
    B -->|Processes data|> C[Database]
    C -->|Stores data|> D[Storage]
```

## Team Management Workflow
The team management workflow is handled by the `app/Http/Controllers/TeamParametersController` and `app/Models/Team` components. The workflow involves the following steps:
1. Team creation: A new team is created, and the team parameters are set.
2. Team member management: Team members are added or removed, and their roles are updated.
3. Team parameter updates: The team parameters are updated, and the changes are reflected in the database.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Creates team|> B[TeamParametersController]
    B -->|Creates new team|> C[Team]
    C -->|Adds team members|> D[TeamMember]
    D -->|Updates team parameters|> E[TeamParameter]
```

## Billing and Subscription Workflow
The billing and subscription workflow is handled by the `app/Http/Controllers/BillingController` and `app/Models/Pricing` components. The workflow involves the following steps:
1. Pricing plan selection: The user selects a pricing plan, and the subscription is created.
2. Payment processing: The payment is processed, and the subscription is updated.
3. Subscription management: The subscription is managed, and the user can update or cancel their subscription.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Selects pricing plan|> B[BillingController]
    B -->|Creates subscription|> C[Subscription]
    C -->|Processes payment|> D[PaymentGateway]
    D -->|Updates subscription|> E[Subscription]
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the FAiQ project uses a combination of modular architecture, user authentication, and data processing and storage workflows to provide a scalable and maintainable solution. The system is designed to handle large amounts of data and user interactions, making it an ideal solution for applications that require high performance and reliability.

### Setup Instructions
To set up the FAiQ project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FAiQ/FAiQ.git`
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Configure environment variables: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Start the server: `php artisan serve`

The following code examples demonstrate how to use the FAiQ project:
```php
// Example usage of the BatchingService
$batchingService = new BatchingService();
$batchingService->processData($data);
```

```php
// Example usage of the Database
$database = new Database();
$database->storeData($data);
```
