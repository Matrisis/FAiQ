# High-Level Component Interactions
This documentation provides an overview of how the components in the FAiQ project interact with each other. The project is built using a variety of technologies, including Laravel, Vue.js, and database systems.

## Component Interactions
The components in the FAiQ project interact with each other through APIs, services, and databases. The main components include:

* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using Vue.js and is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying data.
* **Backend**: The backend is built using Laravel and is responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and providing data to the frontend.
* **Database**: The database is used to store data for the application, including user information, team data, and other relevant information.

## APIs and Services
The FAiQ project uses several APIs and services to interact with the backend and database. These include:

* **Authentication API**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
* **Team API**: Handles team-related data and interactions.
* **Database API**: Handles interactions with the database, including data retrieval and storage.

## Database Interactions
The database is used to store data for the application. The backend interacts with the database using the Database API. The database schema includes tables for users, teams, and other relevant data.

## Code Examples
The following code examples demonstrate how the components interact with each other:
```php
// Backend API Controller
use App\Http\Controllers\API\TeamController;

// Handle team API requests
public function getTeamData()
{
    // Interact with database to retrieve team data
    $teamData = Team::find($teamId);
    return response()->json($teamData);
}
```

```javascript
// Frontend API Call
import axios from 'axios';

// Make API call to retrieve team data
axios.get('/api/teams/' + teamId)
    .then(response => {
        // Handle team data retrieval
        const teamData = response.data;
        // Display team data to user
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Handle error
    });
```

## Setup Instructions
To set up the FAiQ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using Composer.
3. Set up the database using the provided database schema.
4. Configure the backend API and frontend application.
5. Run the application using the provided startup scripts.

By following these instructions and understanding the component interactions, you can set up and run the FAiQ project successfully.
